      After the devastating earthquakes in 2015, a group of friends got together to raise funds to rebuild the school in Taruka, which had been destroyed. Since then, strong bonds of friendship have been forged between the Magnoac area of the French Pyrenees and communities in the Himalayas.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="editable">
        In 2015 Nepal was struck by two massive earthquakes. Many thousands were killed and whole villages were destroyed. Aide Nepal was set up to help fund re-building of schools that were damaged or completely destroyed. In 2016 we funded our first school in Taruka, a subsistance farming community in the foothills of the Himalaya to the west of Kathmandu. The school has 150 pupils from 5 to 10 years old. <br />
        <br />
        We have now been asked to help re-build the school in Budhasing, another farming village in the north of the region. If anything, the families in Budhasing are in greater need! The school there was completely demolished and the children have spent the last two years in a makeshift shelter of bamboo and corrugated metal sheets. With £20,000 we can build a fully equipped four classroom school with toilet and shower.

      <h3>Roy's Trip</h3>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="editable">
        Roy Francis, former soldier and lifelong adventurer, will set off from Kathmandhu on 18 October to climb Mount Parchemuche in the Everest Region of Nepal. Roy hopes to raise £20,000 to rebuild and equip the school at Budhasing which was destroyed during the 2015 earthquakes. Please donate via the link above, or support our fundraising events between now and then.
