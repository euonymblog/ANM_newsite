We left the tranquility of The Eco Resort at just after 6. To get to Budhasing you must first drive out of the Kathmandu valley, best done before rush hour, and head north up the Trisuli valley, on what was a reasonable road. I say was because it is now being transformed by the Chinese into a major highway from Tibet to India. Sadly they are still at the carving out mountain and jungle stage! After 3 hours we stopped for breakfast at the aptly named Highway Break Point! It is amazing what some folk carry on their roof racks.

Just short of Trisuli we left the 'main road', crossed the river, and started the climb to Budhasing. The previous 4 hours were hard on the bum but nothing compared to the final 2 hours on the recently constructed jungle track. All was well until we met a truck coming the other way. After some skilled manoeuvering by our driver we continued the climb to the village.

Budhasing is a typical middle hills subsistence farming village. Pretty much all they grow, predominately rice, they consume. The villagers, young and old, congregated at the school to meet the strange (tall) white man, from far away. One asked me why I (our team) wanted to help them build a school in a place they had never seen for children they did not know. A bloody good question! Anyone got an answer??

The village was severely hit by the 2015 earthquakes. Most of the houses were damaged or destroyed. Luckily the school collapsed on the Saturday, day off! I took a picture of the children sitting on what remains of the school, just a pile of stones. The school they have now was built by the village with what they had to hand and what they could afford.

There are 150 children in the village. They can start school at 3 if the family can afford to send them. The 5 teachers are all funded by the village. I had a few minutes with the council and head teacher. What they would love is a 5 or 6 room, single storey building with an office, toilet and shower. Unusually there is quite a bit of flat space available so it is possible. ALL we need is &pound;20,000!

Having talked school we handed out the knitted hats. Initially the children were reluctant to accept the gifts, not something they had encountered before. After a while they relaxed and they definitely enjoyed being filmed and photographed.

Interestingly the one house not damaged by the quakes is the oldest house in the village. Still home to a three generation family and their animals.

Well, there you have it. Sorry if this report was a bit long winded.

"Can we build it, yes we can".
