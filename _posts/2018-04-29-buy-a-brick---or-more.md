We are now ordering material to rebuild another school destroyed by the 2015 earthquakes. Each 4-room school, with toilet and shower, requires 8000 bricks. <br><br>£2 will buy you 10 bricks, so why not pledge £20 or more to really make a difference? You can pledge [online](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/aidenepalmagnoac).
