"The mountains are calling and I must go", says Roy, and the good news is, he will not be going alone! His friend Jim French has confirmed that he will be joining Tenging Sherpa and Roy on the October trip up Parchemuche.

Jim, a former Para Royal Engineer, has been on Cadet expeditions to Nepal and Canada. Jim is now a teacher and in his spare time helps with the Scout movement and is a D of E assessor. This will be Jim's first Himalayan peak but with his 'low-ratio' legs, he should be fine!
