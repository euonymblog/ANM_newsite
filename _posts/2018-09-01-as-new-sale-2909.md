Is your wardrobe full to bursting? Do you need to get rid of those dresses and trousers that just don't quite fit? If they are in 'as new' condition, why not donate them to our As-new Sale in September, and help them find a new home?

If you have items, you can [contact us](mailto:aidenepalmagnoac@gmail.com?subject=As-new%20sale%2FVide-dressing) to arrange drop-off or collection.

If you would like to be part of the event team we have vacancies in all departments, just [email us](mailto:aidenepalmagnoac@gmail.com?subject=I'd%20like%20to%20help%20out!) to let us know you can help out.

The event itself will be on 29 September 2018 in the Castelnau-Magnoac Salle des Fetes, 10am-4pm. There will be lots of clothes, shoes, accessories and sport equipment, as well as teas, coffees, cake and sandwiches. Come along to browse, or to get yourself a new wardrobe!
