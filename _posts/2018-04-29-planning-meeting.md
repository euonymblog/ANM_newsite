We held a very enjoyable and productive meeting on 9 March to agree a programme of events for this year.  A big thank you to everyone who attended, and who contributed to the wealth of good ideas discussed: and a particular word of thanks to all who volunteered (or were volunteered) to help with our various activities.  We hope you will find the programme to be sufficiently varied to offer something of interest to everyone. Upcoming events include a Garden Event in the summer and and Auction Day on 23 September. Keep your eyes open for more information soon.
