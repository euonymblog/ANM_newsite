Thame, the jewel in the Khumbu.

We have been having net problems but we are back on, fingers crossed.

We left Namche, passed the re-built Gompa, turned west and found the Namche Taxi stand (heli pad). For those with deep pockets it is now possible to land at Lukla by plane and take a heli up to Namche. This saves two days walking but I would not recommend it! I have to admit I wouldn't say no on the way out!

It is 15 years since I was last in the Thame valley, I loved it then, and little has changed. In my mind it really is the Jewel of the Khumbu. There are a few more lodges but far less trekkers. This valley would be an ideal place for genuine adventure/mountaineering activities (Sam Marshall).

On the way up we got our first glimpse of Parchemuche at the head of the Thamo Khola. More obvious to the south of Thame is Thyangmoche 6500m and Panjo Tapa 6696m. Jim's day was made when he secured a discount of 50p on a hand knitted hat. And he is not even from Yorkshire!

We are staying at the aptly named Paradise Lodge. Good size rooms, hot showers, spotless dining room and food Nigel Gifford would be proud of! As the afternoon cloud rolled in we were treated to a surreal view of Thamserku 6608m, to the east of Namche.

Tomorrow we will move up to Thyangbo 4230m, our last night before tenting. We will definitely not have internet up there. Reports will be brief updates via the SatPhone. We expect to be on the dark side for 6 to 7 days. When we do get back on I hope we will have some stunning mountain pics for you.

All is well,

Jim, Roy and team.
