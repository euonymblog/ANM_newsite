Roy has been communicating by satellite phone since moving out of internet range. His 70th birthday was 2 November and late that day we heard the following:&nbsp;

*Good news and bad. We are returned to Camp 2, but we failed to summit by 73metres! Defeated by high winds, severe wind chill and wind slab. As it got dangerous, I called time. PS. It may be some time before Jim climbs another mountain! I appear to have frost nip nose and thumbs.*

The Facebook Group was inundated with people wishing Jim and Roy well. This is an impressive achievement and we're looking forward to congratulating them in person before too long.
