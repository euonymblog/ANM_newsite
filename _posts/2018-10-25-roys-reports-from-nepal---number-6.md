We had two days without a good internet connection, sorry about that.

Since my last report it has been something of an emotional roller-coaster. For the first four days on the trail we met less than 20 people. We then joined the Lukla to Namche trail (the tourists trail).

It is hard to believe but at this time of year there are approximately 1200 people heading from Lukla to Namche and Everest, and the same going in the other direction, every day! I have to remind myself that trekking is an industry and the hub is Namche Bazaar.

We met some very nice people on the trail, and some complete arse-holes! What is it with the 'chosen race'? Why do they think good manners and trail etiquette only applies to others? I did have a little word with one chap!!!

We arrived in Namche yesterday at 16:45.

Today we will hire climbing gear for Jim and do a short acclimatisation walk this afternoon.

All is well and I will be on again this evening.
