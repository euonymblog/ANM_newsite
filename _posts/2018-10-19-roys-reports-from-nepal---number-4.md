“If you can't take a joke don't visit Nepal”.

The alarm sounded at 05:00 and like a coiled spring Jim turned over and swore! Once in the land of the living we finished packing, had a light breakfast and left for the airport at 07:00. Kathmandu was amazingly quiet as many had already left for their home villages to celebrate Dashain.

The domestic airport was quite another story. There were no flights to Lukla yesterday due to bad weather so it was catch-up today! Our flight was scheduled to depart at 09:00 but the Phaplu flight was delayed time and time again to allow Lukla flights to get away. At 12:30 we were called forward and bussed to the aircraft, were we sat, in 36C, for 45 mins!

We eventually landed in Phaplu at 14:15 and after a bowl of garlic soup, the first of many, we started the 4 hour walk to Ringmu. When I last passed this way, some 8 years ago, the route was an idyllic forest trail. The route is now an exceedingly rough, unpleasant, 4x4 track, not good for walking! The old Sherpa houses are as interesting as ever but the walk now has little else to offer. Progress, but sad!

After about 40 minutes a 4x4 came bumping along and in it was our porter with our kit bags. The driver stopped and offered us a lift. Under normal circumstances, and with daylight on our side, we would have declined the offer but not this time. A bone shaking hour later we were in Ringum at the Numbur View Lodge enjoying Ginger Tea by the fire. I stayed in this lodge 10 years ago with a CCF trip and was able to show our host and her children some amusing pics. Tomorrow we will be walking, for many hours!

All is well!
