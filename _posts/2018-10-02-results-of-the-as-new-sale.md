Well, the racks have been put away and the money counted and we made over €1300 at last week's As-New sale! An amazing effort that will buy over 6700 bricks for building schools in Nepal. Many thanks to everyone that came along and bought or donated. But most of all thanks to the volunteers who washed, ironed, hung up and sold the many clothes that were provided. 

Roy heads off to Nepal this week to climb Parchemuche with his friend Jim.
