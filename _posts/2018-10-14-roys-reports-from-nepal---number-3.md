Having had enough of Kathmandu I took myself off for a two day walk-about in the hills around Nagarkot.

It is potato harvest time and the fields are full of ladies bringing in the spuds. Much of what they grow is for family consumption, the surplus going to market. A 60kg sack sells for NR2000, about &pound;13.

I passed houses that had survived the earthquakes, but sadly others had not. I spoke to one lady, now living in wriggly-tin house, as she can not afford to rebuild her traditional house. One lovely old lady tried to sell me her baby goat!

On the outskirts of one village I came across a school with an obvious link to North Yorkshire. There must be a story there.

Today, on my way out, I stopped for a brew and spotted two youngsters heading up the hill. As they got closer I could see they were young girls and carrying water. With Karki's help I found that eldest was 11 and she was carrying 26 litres of water in her doko (basket). How many 11 year old Brit kids could carry 26kgs for 1.5 ks, up hill! I can tell you, I had a real moment!!

My mood was restored when, in the jungle, I came across two little chaps having a picnic while minding the chickens.
