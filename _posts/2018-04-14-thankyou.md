Thank you to everyone who came along to the Quiz Night on 6 April. We had almost 100 people and raised a magnificent â‚¬1000 for the new school. Congratulations to the victors, Off Piste, who received the Ganesh trophy.

Most of all, huge thanks to Charlie and the quiz team, Marcha and the team in the bar, Margot who seemed to be whizzing around like a woman possessed, and the Mayor of Monleon Magnoac for allowing us to use the Salle de Fetes.
