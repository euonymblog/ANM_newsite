Makalu Adventure is headed by Roy's good friend Mohan Lamsal, who provides a lot of local support to Aide Nepal Magnoac. We're delighted that they have been recognised as one of the top Expedition & Trekking companies in Nepal by the Nepal Mountaineering Awards. There are 2165 registered companies and Makalu Adventure was rated in the top 10.

The pic below shows Mohan receiving the award from the Tourism Minister.
