Arrived safe and well, just in time for a light lunch!

The all singing, all dancing, computerized visa system is a complete bollocks! 1.5 hours to clear immigration. More on that later!

The hansom young Sherpa is Phurba Wangchu Sherpa. I have known Phurba for many years. He started with Makalu Adventure as a kitchen boy but is now one of Mohan's most experienced mountain guides. He popped in to say hello having just returned from a successful expedition to Cho Oyu, the sixth highest mountain in the world at 8,188m. Phurba has climbed Everest 10 times, 6 times from the Tibet side, 4 times from Nepal, and many other 8000m peaks. Today he leaves to guide a British group on Ama Dablam, a technical 6812m peak close to Everest.

Tomorrow Mohan, the camera man, and I will leave at 06:00 for Taruka. We plan to spend two days filming and also visiting Budhasing.

More when we return.
