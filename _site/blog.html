      <p class="blogDetails"> September 01, 2018 </p>
      <p class="blogDetails"> Events</p>
       <p> <p>Is your wardrobe full to bursting? Do you need to get rid of those dresses and trousers that just don’t quite fit? If they are in ‘as new’ condition, why not donate them to our As-new Sale in September, and help them find a new home?</p>

<p>If you have items, you can <em><a href="mailto:aidenepalmagnoac@gmail.com?subject=As-new%20sale%2FVide-dressing">contact us</a></em> to arrange drop-off or collection.</p>

<p>If you would like to be part of the event team we have vacancies in all departments, just <em><a href="mailto:aidenepalmagnoac@gmail.com?subject=I'd%20like%20to%20help%20out!">email us</a></em> to let us know you can help out.</p>

<p>The event itself will be on 29 September 2018 in the Castelnau-Magnoac Salle des Fetes, 10am-4pm. There will be lots of clothes, shoes, accessories and sport equipment, as well as teas, coffees, cake and sandwiches. Come along to browse, or to get yourself a new wardrobe!</p>

      <p class="blogDetails"> April 29, 2018 </p>
      <p class="blogDetails"> Announcements</p>
       <p> <p>We held a very enjoyable and productive meeting on 9 March to agree a programme of events for this year.  A big thank you to everyone who attended, and who contributed to the wealth of good ideas discussed: and a particular word of thanks to all who volunteered (or were volunteered) to help with our various activities.  We hope you will find the programme to be sufficiently varied to offer something of interest to everyone. Upcoming events include a Garden Event in the summer and and Auction Day on 23 September. Keep your eyes open for more information soon.</p>

      <p class="blogDetails"> Schools</p>
       <p> <p>We are now ordering material to rebuild another school destroyed by the 2015 earthquakes. Each 4-room school, with toilet and shower, requires 8000 bricks. <br /><br />£2 will buy you 10 bricks, so why not pledge £20 or more to really make a difference?

      <p class="blogDetails"> Events</p>
       <p> <p>Thank you to everyone who came along to the Quiz Night on 6 April. We had almost 100 people and raised a magnificent €1000 for the new school. Congratulations to the victors, Off Piste, who received the Ganesh trophy.</p>

<p>Most of all, huge thanks to Charlie and the quiz team, Marcha and the team in the bar, Margot who seemed to be whizzing around like a woman possessed, and the Mayor of Monleon Magnoac for allowing us to use the Salle de Fetes.</p>

      <p class="blogDetails"> Announcements</p>
       <p> <p>“The mountains are calling and I must go”, says Roy, and the good news is, he will not be going alone! His friend Jim French has confirmed that he will be joining Tenging Sherpa and Roy on the October trip up Parchemuche.</p>

<p>Jim, a former Para Royal Engineer, has been on Cadet expeditions to Nepal and Canada. Jim is now a teacher and in his spare time helps with the Scout movement and is a D of E assessor. This will be Jim’s first Himalayan peak but with his ‘low-ratio’ legs, he should be fine!</p>
