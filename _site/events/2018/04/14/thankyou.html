      <p>Thank you to everyone who came along to the Quiz Night on 6 April. We had almost 100 people and raised a magnificent â‚¬1000 for the new school. Congratulations to the victors, Off Piste, who received the Ganesh trophy.</p>

<p>Most of all, huge thanks to Charlie and the quiz team, Marcha and the team in the bar, Margot who seemed to be whizzing around like a woman possessed, and the Mayor of Monleon Magnoac for allowing us to use the Salle de Fetes.</p>
